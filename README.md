# `~/dotfiles`

⚡️ I mostly use the [`alacritty`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/) terminal cause it's fast, together with [`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/), [`neovim`](https://neovim.io/) and [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/) as my glued together wannabe IDE.

## Under construction

> I am currentyl migrating from `brew` and symlinks to using [`nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual) together with [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager)

## Old news below

🍺 I use [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) together with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/) to install packages and applications when I can. I try to keep as many tools as possible UNIX-compatible because you never know when I move to `GNU/Linux`.

👨‍💻 My day job consists of frontend work in JavaScript/TypeScript and React. I use [`coc-nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/) which works as a intellisense engine, [`LSP`](https://langserver.org/) host and [`supports VSCode extensions`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions/).

🚴‍♂️ When I'm not working I'm busy bikeshedding these `~/dotfiles`, and stumbling around doing functional programming in OCaml, Haskell and more.

🐫 For OCaml I use [`bucklescript`](https://bucklescript.github.io/) and [`esy`](https://esy.sh/).

🌯 For Haskell I use [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/).

More should be written here, okay? thx!
